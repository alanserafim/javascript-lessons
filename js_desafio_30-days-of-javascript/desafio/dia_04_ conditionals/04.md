## Desafio 30 dias de javascript: dia 04 - condicionals


**Anotações**

### If  Else if Else

On our daily life, we make decisions on daily basis. We make decisions not by checking  one or two conditions instead we make decisions based on multiple conditions. As similar to our daily life, programming is also full of conditions. We use *else if* when we have multiple conditions.

```js
// syntax
if (condition) {
     // code
} else if (condition) {
   // code
} else {
    //  code

}
```

**Example:**

```js
let a = 0
if (a > 0) {
  console.log(`${a} is a positive number`)
} else if (a < 0) {
  console.log(`${a} is a negative number`)
} else if (a == 0) {
  console.log(`${a} is zero`)
} else {
  console.log(`${a} is not a number`)
}
```

### Switch

Switch  is an alternative for **if else if else else**.
The switch statement starts with a *switch* keyword followed by a parenthesis and code block. Inside the code block we will have different cases. Case block runs if the value in the switch statement parenthesis matches with the case value. The break statement is to terminate execution so the code execution  does not go down after the condition is satisfied.  The default block runs if all the cases don't satisfy the condition.

```js
switch(caseValue){
  case 1:
    // code
    break
  case 2:
   // code
   break
  case 3:
   // code
   break
  default:
   // code
}
```

```js
let weather = 'cloudy'
switch (weather) {
  case 'rainy':
    console.log('You need a rain coat.')
    break
  case 'cloudy':
    console.log('It might be cold, you need a jacket.')
    break
  case 'sunny':
    console.log('Go out freely.')
    break
  default:
    console.log(' No need for rain coat.')
}
```
### Ternary Operators

Another way to write conditionals is using ternary operators. We have covered this in other sections, but we should also mention it here.

```js
let isRaining = true
isRaining
  ? console.log('You need a rain coat.')
  : console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
```

## 💻 Exercises

### Exercises: Level 1

1. Get user input using prompt(“Enter your age:”). If user is 18 or older , give feedback:'You are old enough to drive' but if not 18 give another feedback stating to  wait for the number of years he needs to turn 18.

   ```sh
   Enter your age: 30
   You are old enough to drive.

   Enter your age:15
   You are left with 3 years to drive.
   ```

    ```js
    let year = Number(window.prompt("Enter birth year"))
    let now = 2023

    if((now - year) >=18) console.log(`You are ${now - year}. You are old enough to drive.`);
    else console.log(`You are ${now - year}. You will be allowed to drive after ${Math.abs( (now - year) - 18) } years.`);

    ```

1. Compare the values of myAge and yourAge using if … else. Based on the comparison and log the result to console stating who is older (me or you). Use prompt(“Enter your age:”) to get the age as input.

   ```sh
   Enter your age: 30
   You are 5 years older than me.
   ```

   ```js
   let myAge = 32
    let yourAge = 53
    let difference = myAge - yourAge
    let situation = difference >= 0 ? "older" : "newer"

    console.log(`I am ${Math.abs(difference)} years ${situation} than you.`)
   ```

1. If a is greater than b return 'a is greater than b' else 'a is less than b'. Try to implement it in to ways

    - using if else
    - ternary operator.

    ```js
      let a = 4
      let b = 3

      if(a > b) console.log(`${a} is greater than ${b}.`)
      else console.log(`${a} is less than ${b}.`)

      console.log(a > b ?`${a} is greater than ${b}.`: `${a} is less than ${b}.` )


    ```


1. Even numbers are divisible by 2 and the remainder is zero. How do you check, if a number is even or not using JavaScript?

    ```sh
    Enter a number: 2
    2 is an even number

    Enter a number: 9
    9 is is an odd number.
    ```

    ```js 
    let number = 24
    console.log(`${number} is an ${number % 2 == 0 ? "even" : "odd"} number.`);
    ```

### Exercises: Level 2

1. Write a code which  can give grades to students according to theirs scores:

   - 80-100, A
   - 70-89, B
   - 60-69, C
   - 50-59, D
   - 0-49, F

    ```js
    let score = 90

    switch(true){
        case score <= 49 && score >=0 :
            console.log("Your grade is: F")
            break;
        case score <= 59 && score >= 50:
            console.log("Your grade is: D")
            break;
        case score <= 69 && score >= 60: 
            console.log("Your grade is: C")
            break;
        case score <= 89 && score >= 70:
            console.log("Your grade is: B")
            break;
        case score <= 100 && score >= 90:
            console.log("Your grade is: A")
            break;
        default: 
            console.log("Your grade is: ?")
    }
    ```

1. Check if the season is Autumn, Winter, Spring or Summer.

   If the user input is :
   - September, October or November, the season is Autumn.
   - December, January or February, the season is Winter.
   - March, April or May, the season is Spring
   - June, July or August, the season is Summer

    ```js
    let month = "july"

    switch(true){
        case month == "september" || month == "october" || month == "november":
            console.log("The season is Autumn")
            break;
        case month == "december" || month == "january" || month == "february":
            console.log("The season is Winter")
            break;
        case month == "march" || month == "april" || month == "may":
            console.log("The season is spring")
            break;
        case month == "june" || month == "july" || month == "august":
            console.log("The season is summer")
            break;
        default: 
            console.log("try again.")
    }
    ```

1. Check if a day is weekend day or a working day. Your script will take day as an input.

```sh
    What is the day  today? Saturday
    Saturday is a weekend.

    What is the day today? saturDaY
    Saturday is a weekend.

    What is the day today? Friday
    Friday is a working day.

    What is the day today? FrIDAy
    Friday is a working day.
  ```
  ```js
  let weekday = "monday"

  switch(true){
      case weekday == "saturday" || weekday == "sunday":
          console.log(`${weekday} is weekend.`)
          break;
      case weekday == "monday" || weekday == "tuesday" || weekday == "wednesday" || weekday == "thurday" || weekday == "friday":
          console.log(`${weekday} is work day.`)
          break;
      default: 
          console.log(`${weekday} is not a valid weekday.`)
  }
  ```

### Exercises: Level 3

1. Write a program which tells the number of days in a month.

  ```sh
    Enter a month: January
    January has 31 days.

    Enter a month: JANUARY
    January has 31 day

    Enter a month: February
    February has 28 days.

    Enter a month: FEbruary
    February has 28 days.
  ```

  ```js
  let month = "june"

  switch(true){
      case month == "january" || 
          month == "march" || 
          month == "may" ||
          month == "july" ||
          month == "august" ||
          month == "october" ||
          month == "december":
          console.log(`${month} has 31 days.`)
          break;
      case month == "april" || 
          month == "june" ||
          month == "september" ||
          month == "november":
          console.log(`${month} has 30 days.`)
          break;
      case month == "february":
          console.log(`${month} has 28 days.`)
          break;
      default: 
          console.log(`${month} is not a valid month.`)
  ```
