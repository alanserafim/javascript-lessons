## Desafio 30 dias de javascript: dia 03

**AnotaÃ§Ãµes**

Booleans

```javascript
let isLightOn = true
let isRaining = false
let isHungry = false
let isMarried = true
let truValue = 4 > 3    // true
let falseValue = 4 < 3  // false

```
Truthy values

    All numbers(positive and negative) are truthy except zero
    All strings are truthy except an empty string ('')
    The boolean true

Falsy values

    0
    0n
    null
    undefined
    NaN
    the boolean false
    '', "", ``, empty string


Operators

![Alt text](image.png)

Arithmetic operators are mathematical operators.

    Addition(+): a + b
    Subtraction(-): a - b
    Multiplication(*): a * b
    Division(/): a / b
    Modulus(%): a % b
    Exponential(**): a ** b

Comparison Operators

Logical Operators

```javascript
// && ampersand operator example

const check = 4 > 3 && 10 > 5         // true && true -> true
const check = 4 > 3 && 10 < 5         // true && false -> false
const check = 4 < 3 && 10 < 5         // false && false -> false

// || pipe or operator, example

const check = 4 > 3 || 10 > 5         // true  || true -> true
const check = 4 > 3 || 10 < 5         // true  || false -> true
const check = 4 < 3 || 10 < 5         // false || false -> false

//! Negation examples

let check = 4 > 3                     // true
let check = !(4 > 3)                  //  false
let isLightOn = true
let isLightOff = !isLightOn           // false
let isMarried = !false                // true
```

Increment Operator
In JavaScript we use the increment operator to increase a value stored in a variable. The increment could be pre or post increment. Let us see each of them:

Pre-increment
```javascript
let count = 0
console.log(++count)        // 1
console.log(count)   
```

Post-increment
```javascript

let count = 0
console.log(count++)        // 0
console.log(count)          // 1

```

We use most of the time post-increment. At least you should remember how to use post-increment operator.

Decrement Operator

In JavaScript we use the decrement operator to decrease a value stored in a variable. The decrement could be pre or post decrement. Let us see each of them:

```javascript
Pre-decrement
let count = 0
console.log(--count) // -1
console.log(count)  // -1
Post-decrement
let count = 0
console.log(count--) // 0
console.log(count)   // -1

```

Ternary Operators

Ternary operator allows to write a condition. Another way to write conditionals is using ternary operators. Look at the following examples:

```javascript
let isRaining = true
isRaining
  ? console.log('You need a rain coat.')
  : console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
isRaining = false

isRaining
  ? console.log('You need a rain coat.')
  : console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
```

```
You need a rain coat.
No need for a rain coat.

```

Window Methods

* alert()

        alert('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript')
        
* prompt()

        let number = prompt('Enter number', 'number goes here')
        console.log(number)

* confirm()

        const agree = confirm('Are you sure you like to delete? ')
        console.log(agree) // result will be true or false based on what you click on the dialog box    


Date Object

![Alt text](image-2.png)

```javascript
const now = new Date()

console.log(now) // Sat Jan 04 2020 00:56:41 GMT+0200 (Eastern European Standard Time)

console.log("year: ", now.getFullYear()) // 2020
console.log("month: ", now.getMonth()) // 0, because the month is January,  month(0-11)
console.log("date/day of the month: ", now.getDate()) // 4, because the day of the month is 4th,  day(1-31)
console.log("day of the week", now.getDay())
console.log("hours: ", now.getHours())
console.log("minutes: ", now.getMinutes()) // 56, because the time is 00:56:41
console.log("seconds: ", now.getSeconds()) // 41, because the time is 00:56:41


```




Getting time

This method give time in milliseconds starting from January 1, 1970. It is also know as Unix time. We can get the unix time in two ways:

Using getTime()

        const now = new Date() //
        console.log(now.getTime()) // 1578092201341, this is the number of seconds passed from January 1, 1970 to January 4, 2020 00:56:41


Using Date.now()

        const allSeconds = Date.now() //
        console.log(allSeconds) // 1578092201341, this is the number of seconds passed from January 1, 1970 to January 4, 2020 00:56:41
        const timeInSeconds = new Date().getTime()
        console.log(allSeconds == timeInSeconds) // true
